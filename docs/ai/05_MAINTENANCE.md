# Documentation Maintenance

You are responsible for keeping this documentation up to date.

## When to Update
*   **New Feature:** If you add a major feature, update `01_MAP.md` if the structure changes, or `02_TECH_STACK.md` if new libraries are added.
*   **Refactoring:** If you change a core pattern (e.g., how DB sessions are handled), update `03_STANDARDS.md`.
*   **New Command:** If you add a script or make command, update `04_COMMANDS.md`.
*   **Correction:** If you find something here is false, fix it immediately.

## How to Update
1.  Read the relevant file.
2.  Edit the file with the new information.
3.  Include the documentation update in your commit/PR.
