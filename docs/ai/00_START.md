# AI Assistant Context - Start Here

Welcome. This directory contains the context you need to work on this repository.

## 🧠 Memory & Context Management

**Crucial:** You are responsible for managing the project's "memory".
*   These documentation files (`docs/ai/*`) are your long-term memory.
*   **Update them** whenever you learn something new about the architecture, add a feature, or change a pattern.
*   If you do not update them, your future self (and other agents) will be lost.

## 🛑 Token Efficiency Directives

1.  **Do not memorize the entire codebase.** Use these docs to find what you need.
2.  **Read only what is necessary.** To save tokens, read ONLY the specific file relevant to your task.
    *   Need to build? Read `04_COMMANDS.md`.
    *   Need to write code? Read `03_STANDARDS.md`.
    *   Need to find a file? Read `01_MAP.md`.

## 📂 Documentation Map

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`01_MAP.md`](./01_MAP.md) | **Map**: High-level directory structure and key file locations. |
| [`02_TECH_STACK.md`](./02_TECH_STACK.md) | **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, and libraries used. |
| [`03_STANDARDS.md`](./03_STANDARDS.md) | **Standards**: Coding conventions, patterns, and "Do's & Don'ts". |
| [`04_COMMANDS.md`](./04_COMMANDS.md) | **Commands**: Build, run, test, and deploy commands. |
| [`05_MAINTENANCE.md`](./05_MAINTENANCE.md) | **Maintenance**: How to keep this documentation up to date. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Understand the Map:** Read `01_MAP.md` to orient yourself.
2.  **Check Standards:** Before writing code, read `03_STANDARDS.md`.
3.  **Run Locally:** Use `04_COMMANDS.md` to set up your environment.
