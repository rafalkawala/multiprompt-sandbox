# AI Assistant Context - Start Here

Welcome. This directory contains the context you need to work on this repository.

## 🛑 Directives

1.  **Do not memorize the entire codebase.** Use these docs to find what you need.
2.  **Update these docs.** If you implement a new pattern, change the architecture, or find these docs outdated, you **MUST** update the relevant file in `docs/ai/`.
3.  **Read only what is necessary.** To save tokens, read the specific file relevant to your task.
